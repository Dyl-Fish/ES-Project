              Temperate rainforests are abundant in natural resources that are essential for various industries and human activities. Timber is one 
              of the most important resources found here. The dense temperate rainforest provides a suitable habitat for tall, straight trees, making
              them a valuable source of commercial timber. Additionally, these rainforests are often located near coastal areas, providing an amazing 
              supply of fresh water sources like streams, rivers, and lakes. Rich soil and moderate climate also play a part in creating such useful
              timber by providing tons of water and materials good for the trees growth.
