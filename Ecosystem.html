              Temperate rainforests are unique ecosystems characterized by a moderate climate and high levels of rainfall. These forests are home
              to a diverse array of plant and animal species, many of which are not found anywhere else in the world. The tmeperate rainforest ecosystem is characterized 
              by tall dense rainforests of various types of trees such as deciduous and conferous trees. The forest floor is covered with a thick layer of
              fallen leaves and branches which provides an ideal habitat for the animals present in the ecosystem. the complex and independent relationships between the various
              species in the tempterate rainforest ecosystem make it a highly productive system that is crucial for maintaining the health of the planet.
