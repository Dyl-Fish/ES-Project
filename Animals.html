              Temperate rainforests are rich in biodiversity, with a wide variety of unique animal species.
              Some of the most common animals in this ecosystem include the black bear, eagle, elk, mountain lion,
              raccoon, and squirrels. These animals are well adapted to the moist vegetation and mild temperatures of the temperate rainforest,
              using the lush foliage to find food and shelter. The majority of the animals in this ecosystem are omnivores, feeding on both plants and other animals.
              Some species, like the black bear, rely heavily on salmon and other fish that live in the rivers and streams of the temperate rainforest.
              These animals play an important role in maintaining the delicate balance of the ecosystem, as they help distribute nutrients and control the population of other species.
              Black bears are adapted to live in temperate rainforests by having certain physical and behavioral characteristics that allow them to thrive in this environment. Some adaptations include:

Fur: Their fur is dense and waterproof to protect them from the rain.

Claws: Their sharp claws allow them to climb trees to escape danger and search for food.

Sense of smell: Their sense of smell is highly developed, allowing them to locate food sources, such as berries and insects, with ease.

Omnivorous diet: Black bears are omnivorous, meaning they can eat both plant and animal matter, which provides them with a variety of food options in the rainforest.

Hibernation: Black bears are able to hibernate during the winter, conserving energy and surviving on stored fat.
