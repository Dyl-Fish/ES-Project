              The temperate rainforest is characterized by its mild,
              wet climate, which provides the ideal growing conditions
              for the lush vegetation that defines this ecosystem. Average temperatures in a temperate rainforest typically range from 40 to 70Â°F,
              with high levels of rainfall throughout the year, often exceeding 100 inches annually.
              This consistent rainfall helps maintain the moisture levels in the soil and supports the growth of the dense vegetation. Additionally,
              the temperate rainforest is often shrouded in mist or fog, which further contributes to the high humidity levels in the environment.
              These climate conditions are essential for the survival of the diverse array of plant and animal species that call the temperate rainforest home.
