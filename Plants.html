              The population of a temperate rainforest typically includes many signature plants, full with lush greens and earthy tones, the temperate
              rainforest is home to few types, but many plants. The plantlife in this ecosystem includes tons of slippery moss that grows nearby streams and 
              on damp soil where the wester redcedar trees emerge alongside the thickening ferns of varying sizes. The temperate rainforest has a wide variety of
              plant life that can be seen throughout the canopy of this ecosystem. Most of the plants lower to the ground are popular among the animal life of the 
              ecosystem. The plants in this ecosystem are 100s of years old and the trees can range fromm 100-250 ft in height.
              The Sitka Spruce, native to the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, has adaptations that allow it to thrive in this environment.
              It has a conical shape that sheds heavy rainfall and provides a large surface area for photosynthesis. Its branches are downward-angled,
              reducing the amount of snow buildup and damage from wind. The dense canopy provides shade for the forest floor and helps retain moisture.
              The roots of the Sitka Spruce are shallow, allowing it to quickly absorb nutrients and water from the frequent rainfall. Additionally,
              its resin-filled buds and thick bark provide protection from fungal infections and insects.
