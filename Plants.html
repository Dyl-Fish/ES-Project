              rainforest is home to few types, but many plants. The plantlife in this ecosystem includes tons of slippery moss that grows nearby streams and 
              on damp soil where the wester redcedar trees emerge alongside the thickening ferns of varying sizes. The temperate rainforest has a wide variety of
              plant life that can be seen throughout the canopy of this ecosystem. Most of the plants lower to the ground are popular among the animal life of the 
              ecosystem. The plants in this ecosystem are 100s of years old and the trees can range fromm 100-250 ft in height.
